# dblp data set is downloaded from http://dblp.uni-trier.de/xml/, we only need dblp.xml file or the .gz packed file
# We first extract all papers published after 2000 and collected as inproceedings.
# We construct a undirected coauthor network by connecting pair of authors if they wrote 5/10/15 papers together.
# We further remove from the contructed network the clusters that only contain two nodes (author pair).
# We construct networks of different size (in term of the number of node 100/300/500/700/1000/2000/3000) by 'snow-ball' sampling nodes from network and retaining all edges among sampled nodes.
# Documents that were written by selected authors (nodes) are selected and represented via bag-of-words features. According to frequeny, we remove words listed in top 5 or bottom 5.  
# LDA is used to extract topics from documents. Topics are considered as actions performed on the co-author network. 
# Each document is assigned to one or more topics, and one topic is a set of papers written in difference time which can be seen as the influence of an action over time.
# We also use LDA to assign words that correlated to each topics.

# Files that are generated after preprossing (e.g. dblp.inp.2000.5.100)
# m is the number of training examples (actions)
# d is the number of features for each examples (words)
# k is the number of targets (nodes in the network)
# l is the number of focal nodes for each actions
