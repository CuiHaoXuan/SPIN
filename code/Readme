Update 04.08.2014
    spin with greedy inference algorithm updated to make sure the ICML2014 results can be replicated
Update 05.08.2014
    spin with greedy inference algorithm correction such that the bug in global_greedy_labeling.m function is corrected


The repository contains codes and some experimental data for Structured Prediction of Network Response (SPIN) algorithm, which appears in International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2014).
The algorithm assumes a network structure as prior (e.g. Facebook) and a set of actions (e.g. posts or messages) performed on the network.
Given a new action, the algorithm predicts the response network, a DAG, that indicates activated nodes and activation order.

The source code is designed for running on computer cluster (UKKO) at the Department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki.
